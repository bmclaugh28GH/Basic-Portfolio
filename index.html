            Hello! I've got over 30 years in software development, having supported applications supporting diverse goals such 
            as personnel distribution and assignment, magazine circulation fulfillment for a business lobby, help desk issues tracking and administration, 
            sales for hierarchy and commission tracking, and most recently, cable media advertising sales. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm originally from south Jersey (Go Eagles! Go Phillies!). I got a BA in computer science from Rutgers University, and 
            served in the US Navy on a ship in Rhode Island and doing IT work in enlisted personnel assignment in northern Virginia. 
            For the last twenty years I've supported domestic advertising sales for Discovery Communications. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm the proud father of two great kids; my wife and I live with them in Silver Spring, MD with our dog, Mabel. 
            In my free time I enjoy playing guitar (poorly), reading, watching TV, and sneaking in a few minutes on my son's Xbox.
